    <h2>Welcome to Powder Keg API!</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      Powder Keg finds the ski resort with the most ideal conditions for a great
      powder day! This API provides weather data (snowfall, wind, sunshine,
      etc.) specific to Colorado ski resorts to help skiers and snowboarders
      plan their trip to the mountain. It also provides awesome pics of skiers
      & snowboarders to get users in the zone.

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Powder Keg is an API which consumes weather data from
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://darksky.net/dev">
        DarkSky
      </a> and
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/ski-weather-api.aspx">
        World Weather Online
      </a>.
      Powder Keg is consumed by my other app,
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://autumn-martin.github.io/ski_meow/">
        Ski Meow
      </a>.
      Ski Meow is a JavaScript single page app that displays weather data for
      local Ski Resorts. Powder Keg also consumes data from
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash</a>, which Ski Meow
      uses to feature a random image for the background.
